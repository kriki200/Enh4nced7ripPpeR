#WARNING ‚ò¢Ô∏è: This is for Linux only @ the moment

#Additional functionality to tidal-dl-ng:

    - Cleaner names, leaves only 1 qrtist in
    - Multiple album downloads, just seperate the albums with "," , like so: https://tidal.com/browse/album/17060800?u,https://tidal.com/browse/album/300315286?u
    - 'Ingredients.txt' file, where you can list all your albums, but have to seperate them with a new line :) . (The template on how to do it is currently in the "Ingredients.txt" üòä.
    - Can download compleate Discographys, just pass the artist LiNK, as so: "https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6450722?u" , withouth the doublequotes, this can also be matche with albums, just seperate everything with ",".

#Notes üòä:

    - The software will create a Done folder within your selected download folder where your downloads will be.
    - When downloading w8 for the files to be transferred to the Done folder before using, as if not it means, that the download hasn't been sorted, cleaned and Str1pped of 4ddi7ional names :) .
    - You will need at least a working TIDAL trial Subscription, to download from it.
    - This software comes with no guarantee, and I am not responsible to any damages, that might occur while using it üòä.
